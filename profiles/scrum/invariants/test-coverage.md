# Test Coverage

## Rule
All stories must have test coverage before they can be marked as done.

## Applies To
All team members working on stories (dev, QE). Applies to all `kind/story` issues.

## Verification
Every story's completion comment includes evidence of test coverage (test names, pass/fail results, or coverage metrics). No story transitions to a done status without test evidence.

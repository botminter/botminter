# Code Review Required

## Rule
All code changes require peer review before merge.

## Applies To
All team members producing code changes (dev, architect). Applies to all project repo contributions.

## Verification
Every code-producing PR has at least one `approved` review from a peer before the merge commit exists. No code commit reaches the main branch without a review record.

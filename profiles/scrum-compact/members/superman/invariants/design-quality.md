# Design Quality

## Rule
Every design document produced by the architect MUST include:
- Overview
- Architecture (with diagram where applicable)
- Components and interfaces
- Acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then format)
- Impact on existing system
- Security Considerations

## Applies To
All `arch_designer` hat outputs.

## Verification
The design document contains all required sections. Each section has
substantive content (not just headers or TODOs).

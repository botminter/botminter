# PR Standards

## Rule

All pull requests follow a standard format and review process.

## Description Template

Every PR body should include:

1. **Summary** — What this PR changes and why
2. **Related Issues** — Issue numbers this PR addresses
3. **Changes** — Bulleted list of specific changes
4. **Testing** — How the changes were validated

## Review Expectations

- At least one team member must review before merge
- Reviewer uses the review format defined in `PROCESS.md`
- Review status must be `approved` before the PO merges

## Merge Criteria

- All reviewers have approved
- No unresolved `changes-requested` reviews
- PR labels are correct
- Related issues are updated with the PR reference

## Scope

PRs on the team repo are for team-level changes only:
- Process document updates
- Knowledge file additions or modifications
- Invariant changes

Code changes to project repos use the project's own PR process.

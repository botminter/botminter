# Code Review Required

## Rule
All code changes require review before merge. In the compact profile, review is performed by the `dev_code_reviewer` hat — a self-review with a different hat context that enforces a reviewer mindset.

## Applies To
All code-producing hats (dev_implementer, architect). Applies to all project repo contributions.

## Verification
Every code change passes through the `dev_code_reviewer` hat before proceeding to QE verification. The code review comment in the issue audit trail confirms the review occurred. No code reaches `qe:verify` without a code review record.
